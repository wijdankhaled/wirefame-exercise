            <p>In the 21st century the style trends of the fashion industry dominate<br>
                 the world more than they ever did, and control not only the way people<br>
                 dress but also trends in home ware design, makeupfashion and peopleâ€™s<br>
                 overall attitudes. In the 60s flower power did not only mean flares and <br>
                 tunics, itsummed up the whole attitude of a generation, and this is even <br>
                 more prominent today.Nowadays, fashion is bold and daring, and this reflects<br>
                 a noughties generation that is not afraid to saywhat they think, or wear what<br>
                 they want.Fashion is not just a means of clothing your body, it is theessence <br>
                 of your personality and beliefs, and designers are well aware of the power they<br>
                  hold. Designers predictions and designs for the coming season are more hotly <br>
                  anticipated than any other revelation inthe world.<br> </p>
